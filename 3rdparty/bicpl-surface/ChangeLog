2009-06-29  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Fixed bug in viewport clipping in render.c (offset out of range would
	  cause seg fault in register)

2008-12-19  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Added obj2brainvisa for conversion from .obj to brainvisa
	* Added rgb option to colour_object for colouring of DTI tracks in .obj
	* Modified Volumes/rend*.c to use size_t as type for loop index
	to allow reading large volumes with more than 2^31 voxels

2007-12-17  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * Added objconcat for concatenation of .obj and .txt.

2007-06-27  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * Added a bunch of new colour maps
        * Moved the surface utilities from conglomerate to bicpl/tools

2005-08-17  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Added Include/bicpl_internal.h
	* Replaced public/private pseudokeywords with BICAPI/static
	
2005-08-11  Andrew Janke  <a.janke@gmail.com>
	* added epm-header.in
	* added netpbm alternative to ppm for OSX

2005-06-03  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* A series of smallish changes for Windows build compatibility:
	
	 - bicpl_clapack/dlamch.c - add volatile to all declarations 
	 of dlamc3_
	 - bicpl_clapack/Makefile.am - put f2c.h and blaswrap.h in a
	 noinst_HEADERS target
	 - Volumes/labels.c - avoid use of global
	 File_order_dimension_names
	 - Transforms/safe_compute_xfm.c - use HAVE_FORK rather than
	 NO_FORK and include config.h
	 - Prog_utils/random.c - If random(), srandom(), and
	 gettimeofday() are not available, use rand(), srand(), and
	 time(). Also make use of the standard constant RAND_MAX 
	 - Numerical/t_stat.c - If gamma() is not defined, use a private
	 copy.
	 - Numerical/numerical.c - Use HAVE_CBRT rather than NO_CBRT and
	 include config.h

	 - configure.in - add checks for fork(), srandom(), random(),
	 cbrt(), gamma(), gettimeofday()
	 - Makefile.am - remove unnecessary m4 files, add the Windows
	 build files	
	
2005-05-02  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Fixed odd problem in dlamch.c.  In the case where GCC 3.4.1 was
	used to compile the code with the -O2 option on Linux, the code
	would hang in an infinite loop in the function dlamc1_(). The bug
	could be avoided by disabling the optimizer. I masked the problem
	by declaring a few local variables 'volatile'.

	(get_quadmesh_patch): Declare quadmesh_struct* as const.

2001-06-06  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	See http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/ply.html.

	* tools/ply.c:
	* tools/ply.h: New.  Routines for reading and writing PLY, from
	gatech's "plytools" package, obtained at the above website.

	Set VERSION to 1.3.3.

	* Makefile.am (libbicpl_la_LIBADD): Link $(BIC_LIBS) and $(imageio_LIBS).

	* Images/Makefile.am: Do not need $(imageio_LIBS).

2001-01-26  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Tagged as release-1_3_2.
	* configure.in: Set VERSION to 1.3.2

	* configure.in: Disable shared libraries by default.

2001-01-23  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Tagged as release-1_3_1.
	
	* configure.in: Set VERSION to 1.3.1.
	* Makefile.am (libbicpl_la_LDFLAGS): Bumped library REVISION number.

	* Makefile.include:
	* Makefile.objects: Removed.

	* INSTALL.bicpl: New.

	* configure.in: Detect whether netpbm or IRIS image library
	is installed, used to read or write image files in Images/rgb_io.c;
	we prefer netpbm over IRIS image.  This is is a change, but previous
	behaviour can be restored using "--without-ppm".

	* Images/Makefile.am: Changes for above.

	* Images/rgb_io_sgi.c: Code formerly in rgb_io.c.
	* Images/rgb_io_ppm.c: New.  Do image I/O using netpbm's PPM files.
	* Images/rgb_io_none.c: New.  Emit error if image I/O function called.
	* Images/rgb_io.c: New.  Dummy file that includes one of the above
	options.

2001-01-05  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Add "--with-build-path" flag to set
	CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS, rather than generating them
	from ${prefix}.
	

2000-12-15  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* acinclude.m4: Update to latest version from smr_macros.

	* Images/rgb_io.c: Include config.h.

2000-10-18  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Volumes/colour_coding.c (define_colour_coding_user_defined):
	check for monotonic colour scale before checking for non-empty
	range, otherwise a non-monotonic scale may falsely claim that the
	position range is empty.

2000-10-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/bicpl/marching_cube_data.h: moved header from Marching_cubes.
	* Include/bicpl/splines.h: restored header from Include/Other.
	These two headers are indeed used by other software packages, notably `Display'.

	* Include/bicpl/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): install newly-restored headers.

2000-06-14  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Volumes/render.c (render_volume_to_slice): applied patch from
	John & Peter.  The patch does not fix the root problem, which
	relates to the calculation of offsets converting from screen
	pixels to volume voxels. It simply prevents the offsets from
	stepping outside the volume. The calculation error appears to only
	affect the edge pixels, so it should not be too serious (apart
	from the core dumping).

2000-02-06  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Include/bicpl/.cvsignore: 
	* README.CVS: new.

2000-02-06  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* autogen.sh: new.

	marching_cube_data.h

	* */*.c: changed all include directives from <foo.h> to <bicpl/foo.h>.
	* Include/*.h: removed all unused headers; moved all but bicpl.h
	into Include/bicpl.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): add Include/bicpl/Makefile.

	* Include/bicpl/minimization.h (downhill_simplex_struct): fully
	prototype evaluate_fit_function.

	* version.c: make version string non static.

	* Images/rgb_io.c (error_function): defined by not used,
	if HAVE_IMAGE_H not defined; moved definition into conditionally
	compiled code.

	* Marching_cubes/marching_tetra.c (translate_to_edge_index): 
	* Marching_cubes/isosurfaces.c (get_isosurface_point): 
	* Volumes/call_rend_f_include.c: 
	* Volumes/mapping.c (clip_points): 
	* Volumes/interpolate.c (interpolate_volume_to_slice): 
	* Volumes/dilate.c (dilate_voxels_3d): 
	* Volumes/create_slice.c (create_weighted_volume_slices): 
	* Prog_utils/arguments.c (get_real_argument): 
	* Objects/polygons.c (add_point_to_polygon, find_edge_index): 
	* Objects/poly_neighs.c (create_polygon_neighbours): 
	* Numerical/numerical.c (get_roots_of_cubic): 
	* Geometry/polygon_sphere.c (get_tessellation_with_n_points): 
	* Geometry/plane_polygon_intersect.c (intersect_planes_with_polygons, 
	intersect_planes_with_quadmesh): 
	* Geometry/clip_3d.c (clip_polygon_against_plane, 
	split_polygon_with_plane): 
	* Data_structures/build_bintree.c (split_node): small changes to
	placate "gcc -Wall", e.g.  add parentheses around && within ||,
	remove unused variables, add braces to avoid ambiguous else.

	* Volumes/scan_objects.c (scan_object_to_volume): 
	* Volumes/col_code_points.c (colour_code_object): several object types
	not handled in switch; add default case that prints error message.

	* Objects/object_io.c (io_object_type): object type N_OBJECT_TYPES
	is not handled in switch; return error.

Thu Jan 20 01:36:43 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/globals.h: fix includes.

	* Include/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): add globals.h,

Wed Jan 19 23:31:36 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* *.c: include <volume_io/foo.h> for internal volume_io headers.

Wed Jan 19 21:52:21 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* TODO: new.

	* configure.in: check for SGI's iris image library.

	* Images/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS, _LIBADD): include flags for
	finding the iris image library and headers.

	* Images/rgb_io.c: do not test OS-dependent symbols (__sgi) for
	the image library; now the code is controlled by HAVE_IMAGE_H
	symbol.

	* Include/Makefile.am (all-local): test -l doesn't exist on linux.

Wed Jan 19 18:05:49 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/Makefile.am (all-local): test -e doesn't exist on IRIX5.

	* Volumes/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): 
	* Numerical/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): include `header' files
	that are named ending in '.c', and hence can't be put into a
	_SOURCES variable, lest they get compiled.

	* */Makefile.am: put -I$(top_srcdir)/Include into AM_CPPFLAGS
	rather than AM_CFLAGS, since it gets put on the command line
	before CPPFLAGS, and the latter might have -I flags that point to
	*installed* versions of the headers.

	* Include/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): new.  List all the
	headers that get installed under include/bicpl.

	* Include/Makefile.am (all-local): make symlink bicpl -> ., so
	that including <bicpl/foo.h> picks up foo.h in the source tree,
	not the previously-installed copy.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): put Include first in the list, since the
	Include/bicpl link needs to be done first.

	* AUTHORS: put in Dave's name and mine.

Wed Jan 19 16:32:48 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): install all headers
	included by including <bicpl.h>.

	* Include/*.h: modify installed headers to include <bicpl/foo.h>
	rather than just <foo.h>; this avoids problems with common header
	names, such as stack.h and the like.  Also, some are incestuously
	including internal volume_io headers, which get modified to
	include <volume_io/foo.h>.

	* acinclude.m4 (AC_PRETTY_HELP_STRING): remove the occurances of
	"if ! command" and "while ! command", which isn't supported by
	IRIX 5.3 /bin/sh.

Wed Jan 19 02:40:27 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: volume_io needs -lm on IRIX.

	* configure.in: search -lnetcdf for `ncopen' rather than
	`nc_open', as the latter does not appear in NetCDF 2.3.

	* configure.in: remove AC_PROG_RANLIB; rendered obsolete by
	AM_PROG_LIBTOOL.

	* */.cvsignore
	* AUTHORS
	* ChangeLog
	* */Makefile.am
	* NEWS
	* README
	* acinclude.m4
	* configure.in: new.  Set up for automake, autoconf, and libtool.

	* version.c: new.  It seems that libtool requires at least one
	real object file in a library to be happy.
