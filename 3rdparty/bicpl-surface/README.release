This recipe was adapted from libtool's release procedure.

We are using libtool to (possibly) generate a shared library.
The library has a three-component version string, written

	CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]

The version started at 0:0:0.




================================================================
= Release procedure
================================================================

* Update NEWS.

* Update the -version-info argument in Makefile.am according to the
  following rules:

  1. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
     update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').

  2. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
     last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.

  3. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
     then increment AGE.

  4. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
     then set AGE to 0.

* Configure, build, and install.

* Run "make distcheck".

* Test build from tarball on another system.

* CVS commit.

* Run "cvs tag bicpl-x_y_z".

* Update version number in configure.in.

* Commit.

* Copy tar file to distribution site.
