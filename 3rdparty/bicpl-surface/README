This library comprises a set of functions for manipulating volumes,
objects such as polygons and lines, some basic geometry, and some
general programming utilities.  It is a layer on top of the MNI Volume
IO library, which is part of MINC.


The following libraries MUST be installed before you can build
bicpl:

  NetCDF and MINC 
    - requires minc version 0.8
    - available at ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/minc/


In addition, it is recommended that at least one of the following
libraries be installed.  The bicpl package will compile without
any of them, but you won't be able to load or save bitmapped images.

  NetPBM             
    - see http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

  IRIS image library 
    - available from SGI for IRIX systems


See INSTALL and INSTALL.bicpl for installation instructions.
